      Imagine it from the parents’ point of view for a second: it’s late, the hallway light is on, explosions and excited voices are leaking through a half-closed door. All they see is a teenager glued to a screen, headset on, laughing at strangers on the internet instead of “doing something productive”.
    </p>

    <p>
      From the outside, it looked like noise, distraction and for them, it was definitely a problem. But inside that room, something very different was happening.
    </p>
  </div>

<p>
<strong>Growing up, we all had that moment : </strong> the door half-closed, the headset on, the bright glow of YouTube illuminating our room while our parents sighed in the background.
</p>

<p>
To them, gaming videos were loud, pointless, maybe even worrying. <strong>To us, they were the closest thing to a home away from home.</strong>
</p>

<p>
Gamers didn’t just watch videos; they shared tips, jokes, excitement, frustration. They weren’t just viewers, <strong>they were part of something</strong>. A community that felt incredibly real, even through a screen.
</p>

<p>
And so the question stayed with us:
</p>

<p style="font-weight:700; font-size:1.15rem; color:#2b8cff;">
Was the gaming community truly as strong and unique as it felt… or were we simply kids romanticizing our childhood?
</p>

<p>
Now that we finally have the tools, the data, and the expertise to step back and analyse YouTube’s ecosystem objectively, we’re ready to uncover the truth.

  <h2>Research Questions</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Is the Gaming category on YouTube characterized by stronger user engagement
      than other content categories?
    </li>
    <li>
      Can interaction patterns between viewers and creators reveal a uniquely
      cohesive community structure?
    </li>
    <li>
      Are there identifiable sub-communities within Gaming, and how do they differ
      in terms of engagement and interaction?
    </li>
    <li>
      Does the structure of the Gaming ecosystem support the idea of a “home-like”
      digital community?
    </li>
  </ul>
